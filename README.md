OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Warfare, and I’m like... whoa, what did I even just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? My brain’s kinda fried, you know what I mean? It’s like a rollercoaster, but not the fun kind, more like the can-I-get-off-now kind. 😂 Seriously, I didn't even expect that twist at the end—like, where did that come from? I swear I called it when the dude walked into the room in act two, but did I actually tweet about it? Nope. Missed my chance to sound all, you know, insightful.

> Dude, the plot was everywhere, like they spilled coffee all over the script and just ran with whatever stuck. 😂 Anyway, not complaining 'cause it did keep me up, even tho I'm lowkey tired af right now. I should probably sleep but here I am. 😅

And the soundtrack, man! It was like they were trying to sync up my heartbeats with grenades or something. Total chaos, and not in a bad way, just... intense, yeah. Remember when I said I’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for a weekend binge? Thank goodness I decided to 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 instead—who needs that kind of commitment with my attention span, right?

The characters though! Like, I get it, you’re all brooding and mysterious, but can we talk about how much eyeliner was involved? It's like a moody teenager took over the makeup department. It gave me high-school vibes, throwback much? 🙄 But, tbh, I was kinda living for it? Haha, I feel like a hypocrite but there you go. Anyway, I’ll probs 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to catch what I missed the first time 'cause my brain tapped out halfway through. Or just to see that one scene where... well, you know the one. 😉

for i in range(5): print(Why am I typing this?)

But yeah, hit me up if you decide to brave it—I need someone else to discuss all those epic-but-also-kinda-dodgy moments with. We can rant about it over coffee or something, or I can just squint at you over my mug while you tell me how wrong I was about the whole underlying theme thing. 😂 Anyway, how’s your weekend looking?
